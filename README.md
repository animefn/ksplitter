# ksplitter
A python tool to split karaoke songs (romaji syl, char, words) for Aegisub without having to know the splitting rules for jp romaji. It saves about 10-15 minutes per song, and avoids you the annoying process of having to go through each word and having to split it. the syl splitting mode is intended for use with Japanese romaji and thus follows rules suitable for Japanese only, the result will be weird with other languages.
